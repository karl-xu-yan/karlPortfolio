  <h1>Karl Yan</h1>
  <p>
    I am a graduating Computer Science major currently seeking full-time and internship opportunities that involve backend development, machine learning, AI, or game design. I have a strong foundation in programming with experience in Unity, C++, and Python. My academic projects have provided me with a solid background in algorithm design, data structures, and object-oriented programming. I am particularly interested in applying my skills in a practical setting and am eager to contribute to real-world projects. I am a quick learner, problem solver, and am ready to take on challenging tasks to further enhance my skills and experience.
